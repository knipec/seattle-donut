        <h2>What is Donut Economics?</h2>
        <p>Or "Doughnut Economics" for much of the world &#128521;</p>
        <p>Humanity’s current challenge is to meet the needs of all (from food and housing to healthcare and political voice) within the means of our planet (stable climate, fertile soils, and a protective ozone layer). Kate Raworth introduced the ideas of <a href="https://doughnuteconomics.org/about-doughnut-economics">Donut Economics</a>, where the “donut” is a way to visualize how well we’re meeting these social and planetary boundaries, on both a local and global scale.</p>
            
        <h2>About this visualization</h2>
        <p><a href="https://doughnuteconomics.org/organisations-and-networks/seattle-donut-economics-coalition">
        Seattle Donut Economics Coalition</a> is pulling together data to understand our Seattle community’s position in these boundaries, serving as a compass for how we can improve (following the methodology of <a href="https://doughnuteconomics.org/tools/creating-city-portraits">Creating City Portraits</a> and <a href="https://doughnuteconomics.org/tools/doughnut-unrolled-data-portrait-of-place">Doughnut Unrolled: Data Portrait of Place</a>). We’ve started by focusing on Local-Social (inner circle) and Local-Ecological (outer circle) impacts, with later iterations to account for our Global-Social and Global-Ecological impacts too. We’re just getting started and this is just a first draft – we’d love to get your thoughts and ideas as we work to improve our understanding!</p>
